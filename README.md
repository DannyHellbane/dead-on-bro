Dead On Bro

A short story exploring the frontiers of lust in the pre-apocalyptic world.

My good friend Bill and I made plans to meet up for a kick about at my local park.  Seemed like a great idea at the time, the Sun was shining and not a cloud in the sky but by the time we got to the park the heavens opened and we had to run for cover.  We regrouped back at my place and tried to salvage the day with a few drinks.  Bill is a fun dude but that day I could tell something wasn't right.  

I didn't say anything because I figure if people feel like talking they would.  If they don't talk, it's probably because I wouldn't shut up long enough.  Or there's not enough beer.  

So I shoved a beer into Bill's hand, and watched him nurse it far too long.  And this is the guy who claimed he invented the beer bong.  I flipped through the channels on the TV and made sure I left enough silence between the last thing I said and the next.

Finally, Bill said, "Do you watch The Walking Dead?

"I've seen a few episodes, here and there."

"I came across it last night,” he said, “binged through a dozen episodes  or so and the strangest thing happened."

"The strangest thing on the Walking Dead?"  I tried to think of a gag but nothing clicked.  I tsked, mentally.  An unfinished joke is like an incomplete sneeze.

"No, not like that," he said.  "They were fighting a horde of zombies as usual.  But the strange thing was I couldn't concentrate on the action."

I nodded.  "That show's been on a while.  It's tough to keep things fresh."

"Yeah," he said, clearly distracted.

"Keep it fresh?" I said.  "Zombies?  Come on."

"Yeah," He said,  "I get it."  He paused.  "It just one of them was really cute."

"Cute? A Zombie?"  I laughed.  Then I mentally rifled through the pictures of the cast. "Yeah, there are a few hotties on that show."  Except I hadn't watched it in a while so I struggled to match names to faces.

Finally, I remembered enough of them to say, "OK, who are you crushing on?"  I grinned.  "Maggie, Michone, Carol, who?"

He shook his head a little and looked away.

"I see." I said and my smile widened. "Interesting.  Who else can it be, hmm." I looked at Bill.  "Is it Rick?  Daryl?  Glenn?"

I paused between each name and waited for any flicker of emotion on his face.  Not that I expected to see any emotion.  Bill's a dude's dude.  So if he was into dudes he'd probably just say, "I like cocks.  Let's have another beer."  And I'd say, "OK." And that'd be it. End of story.

But that wasn't it.  The silence was deafening. His facial expression blank.  He was giving me nothing. 

What is up?  Who else could it be?  And then it dawned on me...  No.  No.  Can't be.  And it just stopped me dead in my tracks, as it were.  My mouth was hanging open, I think.  Total shock. I'm talking about eyes wide without comprehension, rotating, freely, in their sockets. I'm talking about losing the power of speech kind of shocked.  I think I even started talking gibberish, making unintelligible noises like "Grrrh".

No, not really.  I didn't do any of that.  I didn't want to get him excited.   I just clammed right up.  Not a peep. Thinking, "Oh-oh."

Bill glanced up at me.  And I stared back at him.  I think, he could tell from the look on my face what I was thinking.  And I could see it on his face that I had guessed right.

Then he looked away and sank lower into his seat and dropped his head into his hands.  Very out of character for him because he's a big, strong lad who's never far away from a smile.

I just watched and waited.

Finally, he lifted his head.  "It's never happened to me before, Matt" he said.  "It's that one zombie chick," He shook his head.

"Yeah,” I managed to say through a dry throat.  What about her?" 

"She was just so damn cute, man."

I took a deep breath.  I felt all the tension leave my body.  I think, the tension came from thinking that I knew what he was about to say but not being a hundred percent sure.  And because of the provocative nature of it, I was hoping he wasn't going there.  But then to hear him, finally, say it out loud, in some strange way, was a relief.  But it only lasted a second.  As soon as I realised  what'd just happened it hit me like a ton of bricks.  The tension was back.  Ten-fold.  Palpable like Rigor mortis.

It's interesting, though, how quickly the mind tries to adapt to a new reality and clings to any plausible explanation.  "OK." I said,  "Let's reason this out.  Those extras, some of them are actors trying to make it big, right?  Of course they are.  And there are lots of zombies in a horde scene.  So the make up department have their work cut out for them.  See where I'm going with this? Yeah.  So, obviously, the, erm, cute zombie chick that you saw didn't catch that full decomposed flavour,  you know, that real hard core fire hose of nasty that they douse them with.  Does that make sense?"

And I think I managed to convince myself that it does because I felt myself smiling again.  And so with great aplomb and bombast, I said. "She probably is cute!  You're crushing on the actress."

It felt awesome.  I rationalised my way out of a moral crisis. I leapt to my feet, hoisted my hand up in the air, palm open, above him.  "Once again, against all odds, you locked in on the target, you pussy seaking missile, you. Give me five."

He left me hanging, though.  So I lowered my arm and sat back down.  I felt dead tired.  And I was getting a hell of a headache to boot.

After a while, he said, "No.  She was fully realised."

"Realised?"

"Yeah. A stunning vision embodied.  Like a work of art.  A Picasso."

"Forgive me for being pedantic." I said.  "But the apocalyptic scene, a menacing presence, vibes more with [Edvard Munch's The Scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream), don't you think?"

"I don't care." He said.  "She was ripe.  Very ripe."

"Too ripe."

He looked at me and said in a low tone, "It could never be too ripe."

"Erm, I think it can.  What's the word am I looking for?"  I mimed the gestures of someone trying to remember something.  "Oh, that's right. Rotten. Rotten is too ripe." 

"No.  She was beautiful, bro.  I even forgot that there was an actress underneath.  She was just there.  So real.  I re-watched that scene over and over again."

I mulled on that thought.  Or maybe I was mauled by it.  The thought tore me to pieces before I had a chance to digest it.  I felt lost so I defaulted to logic.  "A lot of things have been brought up."  I said.  "Horizons broadened.  Minds blown.  Just let me understand one thing.  What exactly do you find attractive about this zombie chick?"

"Oh, boy." His eyes drifted into the distance.  "How much time do we have?"

"Just give me a top three."

"Alright, let me see.”  He leant back in the seat and pressed his hands together.  “I love the way her jaws ratchet and grind.” he said.  “And the way she scuttles about, arms akimbo."  He paused and sighed, wistfully.  "And, most of all, I just love that whole general decay."

Wow.  But then I thought of a gag.

"Not to mention," I said with all the bro-vado I could muster. "her unquenchable thirst for meat.  Am I right?"

No reaction but you could almost hear the sound of wind in the the trees and rustling of leaves.  Which is, incidentally, identical to the the sound of embarrassing silence.

"She doesn't even know I exist." He said.  And there was real pain in Bill's voice.

"Yeah." I said.  "Because she doesn't exist."

He recoiled at my words.  "Don't say that, Matt."

I burst out laughing.  I laughed so hard that my my sides began to hurt and tears came to my eyes.  It took a while for me to stop. "Well," I said.  "All things considered.  It could be worse." I swiped the tears away with my sleeve.  "Before you told me I was afraid you'd say Carl."

"What?"

"You know."

"Come, on, dude, that's sick."

"Ah," I said.  "And that's where we draw the line, ladies and gents."

But to myself I was thinking this is where one earns his keep as a friend.  I mean, whatever you do with your friends, be it hitting the gym with your bros or playing the World Of Warcraft or dancing the night away with your girlfriends.  That'd be no trick at all.  It's situations like these where your worth as a friend really shines through.  Me? I had nothing.

So I stood up and pulled the old, "Who needs another drink?" tactic. Then I looked around the room,  like there were lots of people there but, of course, it was just the two of us.  I raised my hand.  "I do."  Then I looked pointedly at my friend.  He just sat there, slumped in the chair.  I kept staring, until he shrugged and said, "OK.  Another beer".

"One beer, coming up, Sir."  And I should've stopped there but I couldn't help myself so I did my best Homer Simpson impression. "Mmm, fermented beer." I said.  Bill just shook his head.  So I doubled down on mirth.  "Any Sweet and Sour chicken to go with that, Sir? It's very stale.  Just the way you like it." I said, walking out of the room.  "Or maybe some [Casu Marsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casu_marzu)?"

Once in the kitchen, I downed two shots of tequila, one after the other.  Boom.  To calm my rattled nerves.  Then I scooped the dead worm out of the bottle.  Irrational, I know.  But better safe than sorry.  You're safer here, little fella.

I also thought about what I would say when I went back into the room.  What could I say?  "So, dude, the Zombie Apocalypse, wouldn't be so bad for you, huh?  Talk about every cloud having a silver lining!"  

Or I could drop some classic behavioural reprogramming on him, "Have you tried not watching that show any more? or "Dude, how about a 'Ballers' marathon?" and the ever-green "Some say reading the Scripture can help."

No, I needed a more practical approach.  And then I had a light bulb moment.  I grabbed beer and tequila and ran back into the room.

"Bro," I said, "have you looked online? There's probably a dating app for that."

He sat up, a devilish glint in his eye.  "Now you're talking!”

"Dead on, bro." I said.  "Dead on.  Now reach me that phone."
